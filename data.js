      subtitle: "Everybody´s path is unique. This is mine...",
      paragraph1:
        "I started working at Cafe de las Ciudades, a book publisher specialized in Urbanism, in 2019. I was in charge of comercialization, a role which included dealing with customers, suppliers and book shops. I suggested opening an ecommerce site, which I created with a CMS (TiendaNube). I also ran a strong ad-campaign on social media. They were thrilled to see the results (and their invoicing grew sevenfold!), so then I was in charge of re-designing the website for their monthly newsletter, on its 20th anniversary. I managed to do that with another CMS (Wordpress). I got more and more deeply involved in programing websites and suddenly I realized that I had encountered my new passion. ",
      paragraph2:
        "Then I got a new job at Yaguar.xyz, a network of independent professionals in the field of art and technology applied to entertainment and education. With them I built a set of gamified simulations of job interviews, maintenance of surfaces and textiles, and management of work agenda oriented to the care of the elderly, for the Training Course of the School of Domestic Service.",
      paragraph3:"I got really focused on learning everything about web developing while working on a lot of different projects for people  around (and later for unkowned clients in Feverr). The word kept running mouth to mouth and I ended up building and designing a lot of projects to reach different expectations. Now I have a strong desire to be involved in a group of people to participate in building bigger things, keep the level of complexity going up and to continue learning and growing as a developer.",
      paragraph4:
        "I think I can add a really good base on soft skills, I´m used to working with people from different cultures and can communicate clearly in English, Spanish and Portuguese. I´ve worked in the music industry, in the production field, so I´m used to dealing with deadlines, group leadership and tricky commercial affaires.",
